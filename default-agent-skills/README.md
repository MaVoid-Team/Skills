# 🚀 Antigravity Agent Skills Repository

A comprehensive collection of domain-specific knowledge modules (skills) that enhance your Antigravity agent's capabilities. Skills automatically activate when you mention relevant keywords, providing intelligent assistance for specific domains.

**Status:** ✅ Ready for Team Use | **Last Updated:** March 6, 2026 | **Maintained By:** Your Team

## 📚 What Are Skills?

**Skills** are domain-specific knowledge modules embedded in an agent that automatically activate based on keyword detection. Instead of manually specifying what you need, just describe your task naturally — the agent will recognize keywords and activate the appropriate skill.

### How It Works

```
User: "I need to deploy my Node.js app to VPS with Docker"
       ↓
Agent detects keywords: "deploy", "Docker", "VPS"
       ↓
Agent activates deployment-skill from SKILL.md
       ↓
Agent provides Docker, Nginx, and deployment guidance
```
