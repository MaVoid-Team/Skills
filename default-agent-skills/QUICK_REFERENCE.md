## 🎯 What Are Skills?

**Skills** = domain-specific knowledge that the agent automatically uses when you mention related keywords.

**How:** Just ask naturally about your task. Keywords trigger the right skill.

```
You: "Create Docker config for my Node app"
      ↓
Agent detects keywords: Docker, Node, config
      ↓
Agent activates deployment-skill
      ↓
You get complete Docker setup help ✓
```

→ Agent shows real production example
```

### Tip 3: Mix Skills
```
"Plan deployment for my Node app and create Docker setup"

```

### Tip 4: Save Good Answers
```
When agent gives good config:
1. Copy the output

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Activating?
**Try:** Use keywords from skill description  
**Or:** Be more specific about what you need  
**Or:** Ask agent "What deployment files do I need?"

### Can't Find Example?
**Check:** examples/ folder in deployment-skill  
**Or:** Read examples/README.md for how to add one  
**Or:** Ask agent "Similar to [tech-stack]?"

### Need Different Tech Stack?
**Check:** resources/ folder for templates  
**Or:** Ask agent to adapt an example  
**Or:** Read creating-skills to build custom skill
